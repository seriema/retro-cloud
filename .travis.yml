#
# I would prefer to have bashValidation, imageValidation, and scriptValidation running in parallel
# as they are not blocking and builds take long enough, but I haven't found a good way in Travis
# that also is visually easy to follow in the web interface. Having everything regarding
# scriptValidation in one job hides every step inside a giant console log which is impossible to
# track down what step went wrong.
#

# I won't be stopping the container. I need to learn more about Travis to know when it would be a
# good time (after everything is run, even if steps failed), but it also adds time to my build.
# Seems pointless as Travis will shut down the VM that's running the container anyway.
